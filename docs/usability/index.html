        <h3>Usability Testing General Information</h3>
        FGT and CTA were used for our usability testing. <br>
        Participants were instructed that there was not a time limit and that the instruction steps are designed to be referenced throughout the assembly. <br>
        <h3>Expected issues</h3>
        We expect that there will be some issues with the description of the Lego pieces (colors and size). We constructed the first set of instructions using different forms of explanations for the steps to see which types of instructions receive the best reviews for ease and clarity. <br>
        We have not constructed an instruction set for the base piece. However, we expect that the instruction sets for the Ferry and the base will be fine-tuned after feedback from the test. <br>
        <h2>Usability Test Results</h2>
        <h3>FGT questions and feedback:</h3>
        What format of instructions were the easiest to follow? The instructions for the space needle design.<br>
        What was the clearest way to describe the color of the Legos (mainly between the different blues and greens)? No issues with photo reference. 
        Between the following, what was the clearest way to describe the size of the Legos; 16 prongs versus 2x8 Lego? The testing group was divided. After further research, we decided that we would reference the size similarly to how they are referenced in real Lego brand instructions.<br>
        <h3>CTA feedback:</h3>
        Some missing pieces in the steps that are in the pictures, but not in the instructions. Need more clarity with direction of where to place the pieces, specifically for the Mt. Rainier design. The Ferry design was slightly confusing in the beginning and could be adjusted to make it easier for the assembler. The Mt. Rainier instruction set was the most difficult to follow. I can assume how to put these together based on pictures, but there arenâ€™t any final instructions at the moment. Pictures were very necessary to be able to follow some of the instructions. <br>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        After our usability testing and feedback was recorded, we decided to make the following changes:<br>
        List Lego piece sizes in traditional Lego standards (i.e., 2x2)<br>
        Update instructions for the base set<br>
        Update instructions for the ferry set<br>
        Clarified and simplified the instructions for the Mt. Rainier set<br>
