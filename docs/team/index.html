            <!-- <div class="bioText"><p><strong>Carter Anderson is an open-minded problem solver, with a wide variety of technical skills and educational backgrounds.</strong><br> </p>
        
                <p>When approaching a new project, Carter likes to experiment with different ways of creating, learning a bit about each method before deciding how to move forward with the project. This helps him find the best ways to solve problems and complete projects, as well as gain knowledge about many techniques and strategies for use in future projects. This approach has allowed him to apply his knowledge to his varying interests and pick up many skills along the way. <br> </p>
    
                <p>Throughout his high school years, Carter has gained a wide variety of skills including programming in many different projects from games to simulations to websites. In his freshman year, he created a program to control lights which included features like remote control, web control, and many different visual effects. In his sophomore year, he collaborated with a colleague from New Zealand to create several different game environments that they sold to various popular games. In his junior year, he developed a full stack application for his robotics team with features such as database storage, responsive design, and real-time updates. Throughout this work he has gained experience with several languages including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for web applications, basic C# for creating games, C++ for his microcontroller projects, as well as Java through several courses at Olympic College.<br> </p>
    
                <p>When Carter is not developing, he spends time practicing as a varsity highschool sailor, as well as working with his local robotics team to design, build, and program a new robot every year. <br> </p>
